        I am a full stack engineer with a lot of experience building things. I have multiple yearsâ€™ experience working with Node.js and Python. I began working with MongoDB and Redis when working with social media data at my startup and I've worked with both on several projects over the last few years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of my experience is in developing web applications, but I have worked with a variety of platforms and technologies to build software and have deployed software to the web, Mac OS X, and Linux. My experience using many different programming languages has exposed me to new paradigms, which helps me pick the best tool for each job.
      </p>

      <p>As a founder, I've launched two products. Both were SaaS applications involving large sets of (social) data and I built the technical stack. I have experience evaluating general objectives and then building the infrastructure and applications to meet the goal. </p>

      <p>
        Lately I have been doing a great deal work in Meteor and building a data collection system in node. Due to how often I need to collect social media data and the number of different APIs (sometimes multiple per provider!) I built a service that offers APIs for collectors to register their functionality, clients to register their data needs, and clients to gather their collected data. This allows me to use (Twitter/Facebook/Instagram) bots in multiple applications while only having to do the work of writing the logic and building/deploying infrastructure once. There was a software startup using my data collector to power their product. I have learned a lot by building applications that my peers are using; documentation, tests, and clear communication are critical for the success of their projects and mine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most recently, I built and launched a chat bot for League of Legends, in a week. The project is online at https://github.com/jhgaylor/StatBot/wiki/Day-0:-The-Beginning. Please feel free to check out the repository as an example of my work.
