          <h3>Hacker and Entreprenuer</h3>
          <p>
            My passion for programming was sparked in 2001 doing CRUD on a LAMP. I have a ton of experience developing web applications, but I have worked with a variety of platforms and technologies to build software and have deployed software to the web, Mac OS X, and Linux. My understanding of many different programming languages and frameworks has exposed me to new paradigms, which helps me pick the best tool for each job. I do any work I can openly on Github and am a big fan of open source. I love talking shop, so reach out if you want to chat.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started a company in 2013 and I launched two products. Both were SaaS applications involving collecting and curating large sets of social media data and I built the technical stack from servers to CSS. I learned to do a lot of non technical things things as well while starting NestedData, including writing copy, managing finances, hiring, firing, negotiating contracts, marketing, on boarding, and most of all how to talk to customers.

          <h3>Developer</h3>
          <p>
            I have 5 years experience hacking professionally. I've worked on internal productivity tools, social media applications for social scientists, open source blogging software, an xmpp chatbot to provide a CLI to the vast League of Legends data on the web, a bunch of microservices (Ask me about my social media router and I'll talk your ear off!), and a ton of other projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given a set of objectives, I can evaluate them to then build the infrastructure and applications to meet the goals. I'm a hacker at my core, so I thrive in an environment where I am able to help determine the objectives, though the entreprenuer in me really wants to talk to the users in order to challenge my assumptions.

          <h3>Ops</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Automated, repeatable deploys</strong> -
            I've used both Ansible and Chef to model infrastructure as code in order to be able to test my infrastructure before releasing new version. A solid ansible codebase saved my team's bacon when our cloud node's physical host died. We were up again in minutes and only one person had to be distracted by what could have been a catastrophe. 
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>CI/CD</strong> - 
            Using Code Review, Docker, Jenkins, and a solid test suite, I built a CI/CD pipeline for the SocialDrizzle web app and it's supporting services. Our team was able to make changes to the application and see them in production as soon as they passed muster, without having to waste time doing repetitive, error prone tasks.

          <h3>Recent Past</h3>
          <p>
            Lately I have been doing a great deal work in Meteor and I recently built a social media data collection system in node that allows me to use (Twitter/Facebook/Instagram) bots in multiple applications while only having to do the work of writing the logic and building/deploying infrastructure once.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most recently, I built and launched a chat bot for League of Legends, in a week. The project is online at https://github.com/jhgaylor/StatBot/wiki/Day-0:-The-Beginning. Please feel free to check out the repository as an example of my work.

          <h3>Future</h3>
          <p>
            I'm looking for work as a Fullstack or Backend engineer. A good gig would have me hacking on Node/Go/Ruby and might include building a mobile or web frontend and/or being responsible for the deployment pipeline. I tend to enjoy working on projects that employ microservices and a web component.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm still looking for my next side project, but I'm leaning towards doing some open source work in the Meteor community. If there is a project you think I should help out, drop me a line!

              <strong>About</strong>
              <p>
                A chat bot for League of Legends. LoL players, especially those not in the top tier of competitive play, often need more information about the game... quickly! It is quite common for players to "alt-tab" to sites like lolking, lolnexus, lolcounter, probuilds, or many others. Once on the site gamers have to type, click, and wait on load times, all while under extreme time pressure. To make matters worse, they often need information from one (or multiple!) source(s) during champion select, another source at the load screen, and yet another during the game. All of these things add to the players' stress level, and some times, they don't get done in time. Thus these constraints have in game ramifications. Statbot makes it easy to get all the information you need instantly in game.

SMTAS is focused on the social network, Twitter, where researchers have access to approximately 500 million tweets per day. Tweets are public postings made by worldwide users of Twitter. Apart from the real-time access to Twitter, SMTAS also has access to historical data/tweets posted via Twitter since 2006. Apart from Twitter data being a rich information source of human behavior (170 million active users) in a social network, it also provides researchers instantaneous information from its user base with its faster (compared to other social networks) message propagation.

                <strong>About</strong>
                "Timemaster" was desperately needed by Mississippi State University's (MSU) Social Science Research Center's (SSRC) Survey Research Laboratory (SRL) in order to wrangle the timesheets of 80+ intermittent workers. The tool saved a team of 4 supervisors a significant amount of time that was being spent on paperwork.
