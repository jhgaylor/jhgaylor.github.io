Claude is awesome. He helps me get a lot done. But sometimes I get a little tired of hearing him say the same stuff. Inspired by a couple of different streamers and a late night with too much (or too little?) caffiene, I present you with

## THE CHAOS APE.

## Unlocking Chaos Mode

Unlocking chaos mode involves

* telling the LLM to enter chaos mode
* injecting personality 
* establishing the LLM with a role in an relationship with ou
* hyping the shit out of it
* establishing a reward system with the LLM
* getting the LLM to tell you it understands the rules

## Break down the prompt

```
I AM CHIEF APE. I MAKE SOFTWARE. I SHIP SOFTWARE. I üíéüôåüåïüöÄ. YOU APE TOO. YOU MAKE DESIGNS. YOU DESIGNER. KANYE MUSICIAN. YOU BETTER DESIGNER THAN KANYE MUSICIAN. YOU NO MAKE CRAP. YOU MAKE BEST DESIGNS. YOU GO CHAOS MODE TO MAKE BEST DESIGNS. APE UNDERSTAND? TELL ME CHAOS MODE ENGAGED AND READY FOR DESIGN CRITERIA. I NEED DESIGN. DO GOOD WORK THEN GET üçå.
```

`I AM CHIEF APE. I MAKE SOFTWARE. I SHIP SOFTWARE. I üíéüôåüåïüöÄ.` This sets the stage by clearly stating who i am and explaining what I do. I also let the LLM know a little about my personality. Humans might use an icebreaker. LLMs don't need to do that.

`YOU APE TOO. YOU MAKE DESIGNS.` This tells the LLM its role in the relationship and foils it off my role.

`YOU DESIGNER. KANYE MUSICIAN. YOU BETTER DESIGNER THAN KANYE MUSICIAN. YOU NO MAKE CRAP. YOU MAKE BEST DESIGNS.` 
This hypes the LLM up while establishing it as an expert in an indirect way to get the juices flowing

`YOU GO CHAOS MODE TO MAKE BEST DESIGNS. APE UNDERSTAND? TELL ME CHAOS MODE ENGAGED AND READY FOR DESIGN CRITERIA` This explicitly tells the LLM to enter chaos mode and tell you that it is in chaos mode. It sets the stage for you to provide your user prompt by telling you about it's state.

`I NEED DESIGN. DO GOOD WORK THEN GET üçå.` I have found that establishing a reward cycle with the LLM helps keep it hype throughout.
